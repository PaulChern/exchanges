Please run examples as
PATH_TO_EXCHANGES/exchanges.x < exchanges.in > exchanges.out

The first example ( exchanges.distance.in ) demonstrates calculation
of Heisenberg model exchange parameter in a 'distance' mode. In that
mode the code will try to find all atoms within a sphere with radius
defined as 'distance' parameter in the input file (in alat units).
Since the nearest neighbouring atoms in NiO are located on 0.707
distance, in the first example the code don't find an additional atoms
and calculates the exchange parameters only for atoms included into
the hamiltonian.

You can use file exchanges.distance.out.reference for comparison
with your output.

Another example (exchanges.list.in) demonstrates how to list
atoms of interest by hands. Please note the 'mode' flag in the input
file, the ATOMS_LIST section and the increased 'distance' value.
All atoms listed in the ATOMS_LIST section should be located closer
than 'distance' value to the first atom.

YES, WE USE THE FIRST ATOM OF THE HAMILTONIAN AS A REFERENCE POINT
FOR THE NEAREST NEIGHBOURS SEARCH.
